In fall of 2018 when I first started at the Shidler College of Business, I was a direct admit program freshman and I was so nervous. When starting with BUS 200 I initially thought I was going to be a marketing and international business major but something just didn't sit right with me, almost like something was missing. I do have a passion for marketing and love creating content and applying marketing theories and I also love learning about other cultures and languages. However, another one of my passions has always been math and numbers. Math was one of my favorite subjects in school, especially statistics. After talks with friends and older Shidler students I then realized I really love data analytics. This became more apparent in the BUS 310 course and I also really loved BUS 311. That was when I started to look more seriously into the management information systems major and I realized it was so much more than just coding (which was what I had initally thought). With more understanding I decided to pursue a double major in management information systems and marketing. 

Since making this decision, I sought out an internship in management infromation systems this past summer. I ended up interning in the Application Operations department for Bank of Hawaii and it confimred my love for the MIS major. In my role, I was able to redesign our internal websites and track data related to our application's key performance indicators and I really enjoyed my work. Another part I learned I love about MIS is how technologies are constantly changing and there is always something new to learn. I am now excited for the challenges this major is sure to hold and can't wait to learn more!
